# Data Import Instructions

## Importing Data through Django Admin

Django-import-export has been configured for the Menu and Delivery Driver models. Here's how to import data:

1. First, install the import-export package:
   - Run the following command in your terminal:
     ```bash
     pip install django-import-export
     ```

2. Ensure you're logged into the Django admin interface:
   - Go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/`
   - Log in with your admin credentials

3. Navigate to the model you want to import data for:
   - For Menu data: Click on "Menus" in the admin interface
   - For Delivery Drivers: Click on "Delivery drivers" in the admin interface

4. Import Data:
   - Look for the "Import" button in the top right corner
   - Click on "Import"
   - Choose your file format (CSV, XLS, XLSX, etc.)
   - Upload your data file
   - Click "Submit"

5. Preview and Confirm:
   - Review the preview of your data
   - Make sure the columns match correctly
   - If everything looks correct, click "Confirm import"


## File Format Requirements

### Menu Data Format
Your CSV/Excel file should have these columns:
- name
- description
- price
- category
- is_available

### Delivery Driver Data Format
Your CSV/Excel file should have these columns:
- name
- contact_number
- vehicle_type
- license_number
- availability_status

## Tips
- Make sure your data file is properly formatted with headers matching the model fields
- Use UTF-8 encoding for CSV files
- For dates, use YYYY-MM-DD format
- For boolean fields (like is_available), use True/False or 1/0

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues:
1. Check that your column names exactly match the model fields
2. Verify your data format matches the expected format
3. Make sure all required fields are included in your import file
